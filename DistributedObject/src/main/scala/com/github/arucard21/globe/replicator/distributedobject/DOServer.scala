  /*
  The API accepts the following requests:
  - / (root)
    - POST: handles requests from other objects
      returns 200 OK if successfully handled
  - /acquireLock
    - POST: acquire a lock from the replication subobject
      returns 200 OK if the lock was successfully acquired or 409 Conflict if it could not be acquired
  - /releaseLock
    - POST: release a lock from the replication subobject
      returns 200 OK if the lock was successfully released or 409 Conflict if it could not be released
  - /getNumber
    - GET: retrieve the number stored in the semantics object
      returns 200 OK with the retrieved number in the response body as plain/text
  - /setNumber/<number>
    - POST: set the number stored in the semantics object to <number>
      returns 200 OK if the number was successfully stored or 500 Internal Server Error if it could not be stored (possibly due to replication failure)
